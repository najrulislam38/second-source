            <p>From 26 October 2024, employers will face a new duty to take reasonable steps to prevent sexual harassment of workers in the course of their employment. This obligation, introduced by the Worker Protection (Amendment of Equality Act 2010) Act 2023, requires employers to be proactive in identifying and addressing potential risks of sexual harassment, rather than just responding after an incident has occurred.</p>
            <p>This new duty is a preventive measure, emphasizing the need for employers to anticipate scenarios where workers may be subject to harassment and to put measures in place to avoid them. Importantly, while it covers sexual harassment, it does not extend to other forms of harassment based on protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010. Employers will need to show the specific steps they have implemented to comply with this requirement.</p>
            <p>The updated guidance from the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), released on 26 September 2024, provides comprehensive advice on how employers of different sizes and types can adhere to the duty. The EHRC also issued an eight-step guide to help employers understand how to prevent sexual harassment in their workplaces.</p>
